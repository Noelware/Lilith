/**
 * Represents a singleton. A singleton is a way to share objects within Lilith services, and since singletons
 * are injectable, you can use the [[Container#inject]], [[inject]], or the [[@Inject]] decorator to inject
 * it into services.
 *
 * Singletons can only be objects, not primitives (i.e, string, number, boolean). Singletons must be constructed
 * without any prior knowledge on how to construct itself. Singletons doesn't have lifecycle events also!
 *
 * Singletons are also **lazily evaluated**, they're only loaded once they are needed. Otherwise, you might
 * want to opt in for **variables** that are loaded automatically.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { singleton, createLilith } from '@lilith/core';
 *
 * class SomeObjectToHold {
 *   doSomething(): void { console.log('I did something!'); }
 * }
 *
 * const container = createLilith({
 *   singletons: [
 *      singleton(() => new SomeObjectToHold())
 *   ]
 * });
 *
 * container.start();
 *
 * const singleton = container.inject(SomeObjectToHold);
 * singleton.doSomething();
 * // console printed "I did something!"
 *
 * container.destroy();

/**
 * Represents a variable that can be used immediately. This is only useful in the `@lilith/config` library,
 * or you can create variables. **Variables** are different from singletons, **Variables** can hold
 * any data type (string, boolean, number, etc), but singletons can only hold **objects** that are
 * constructed.
 *
 * You might want to use **variables** over **singletons** for:
 * - Configuration injection (i.e, with `@lilith/config`)
 * - Easy lookup for values that you might need in services.
 *
 * You might want to avoid **variables** for:
 * - Objects that should be lazily-loaded, while **variables** are loaded and kept automatically
 *   in the container tree, rather than lazily evaluated when looked up.
 *
 * @warning Variables are loaded even if **Container#start** was not called.
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { createLilith } from '@lilith/core';
