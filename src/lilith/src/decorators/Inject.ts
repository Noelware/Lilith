/**
 * Injects a service or singleton into the parent class by the constructor, or a property of that
 * class. Injections happen automatically when you start your container, so be wary of that.
 *
 * Injections are also scoped to the service that it is targeting. Before Lilith v6, injections were
 * scoped to the global object, so you could use the `global` object to get all the injection references. Now,
 * they're stored in the service's class metadata.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { Service, singleton, createLilith } from '@lilith/core';
 *
 * class SingletonThing {
 *   doSomething(): void { console.log('Hello, world!'); }
 * }
 *
 * (@)Service({ name: 'my service name', priority: 200 })
 * class MyService {
 *    (@)Inject
 *    private readonly singleton!: SingletonThing;
 *
 *    onLoad() {
 *       this.singleton.doSomething();
 *    }
 * }
 *
 * const container = createLilith({
 *    singletons: [SingletonThing],
 *    services: [MyService]
 * });
 *
 * // start the container so injections can apply
 * container.start();
 *
 * // you should see 'Hello, world!' printed to the terminal.
 * container.destroy(); // Destroy the container and release the instance away.
 * ```
