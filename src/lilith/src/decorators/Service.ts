/**
 * Provides metadata about the target class that should be treated as a service that can inject
 * other services.
 *
 * You can retrieve all the metadata about all services in the {@link Reflect} object, as an example:
 * ```ts
 * // You are required to have `reflect-metadata` installed. It is a peer dependency to @lilith/core.
 * import { Service, MetadataKeys } from '@lilith/core';
 *
 * (@)Service({ name: 'my service name', priority: 100 })
 * class MyService {}
 *
 * const metadata = Reflect.getMetadata(MetadataKeys.Service, MyService);
 * // => { name: String, children: any[], priority: integer } | undefined
 * ```
 *
 * Lilith does injecting from the constructor, or any properties automatically when you initialized
 * your container, so you don't have to do it yourself. You can also use the [[Container#addService]] to
 * add a service at runtime.
 *
 * @param param0 The {@link ServiceDecoratorDeclaration} object.
 * @param param0.priority The priority of this service to be loaded. The higher the service priority is, the more chances it'll be loaded first.
 * @param param0.children A {@link Load} type that can represents an absolute path, array of classes/instances.
 * @param param0.name The name of the service, to identify itself.
 * @returns A {@link ClassDecorator}.
